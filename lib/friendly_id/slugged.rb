  # @guide begin
  #
  # ## Slugged Models
  #
  # FriendlyId can use a separate column to store slugs for models which require
  # some text processing.
  #
  # For example, blog applications typically use a post title to provide the basis
  # of a search engine friendly URL. Such identifiers typically lack uppercase
  # characters, use ASCII to approximate UTF-8 characters, and strip out other
  # characters which may make them aesthetically unappealing or error-prone when
  # used in a URL.
  #
  #     class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
  #       extend FriendlyId
  #       friendly_id :title, :use => :slugged
  #     end
  #
  #     @post = Post.create(:title => "This is the first post!")
  #     @post.friendly_id   # returns "this-is-the-first-post"
  #     redirect_to @post   # the URL will be /posts/this-is-the-first-post
  #
  # In general, use slugs by default unless you know for sure you don't need them.
  # To activate the slugging functionality, use the {FriendlyId::Slugged} module.
  #
  # FriendlyId will generate slugs from a method or column that you specify, and
  # store them in a field in your model. By default, this field must be named
  # `:slug`, though you may change this using the
  # {FriendlyId::Slugged::Configuration#slug_column slug_column} configuration
  # option. You should add an index to this column, and in most cases, make it
  # unique. You may also wish to constrain it to NOT NULL, but this depends on your
  # app's behavior and requirements.
  #
  # ### Example Setup
  #
  #     # your model
  #     class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
  #       extend FriendlyId
  #       friendly_id :title, :use => :slugged
  #       validates_presence_of :title, :slug, :body
  #     end
  #
  #     # a migration
  #     class CreatePosts < ActiveRecord::Migration
  #       def self.up
  #         create_table :posts do |t|
  #           t.string :title, :null => false
  #           t.string :slug, :null => false
  #           t.text :body
  #         end
  #
  #         add_index :posts, :slug, :unique => true
  #       end
  #
  #       def self.down
  #         drop_table :posts
  #       end
  #     end
  #
  # ### Working With Slugs
  #
  # #### Formatting
  #
  # By default, FriendlyId uses Active Support's
  # [parameterize](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveSupport/Inflector.html#method-i-parameterize)
  # method to create slugs. This method will intelligently replace spaces with
  # dashes, and Unicode Latin characters with ASCII approximations:
  #
  #     movie = Movie.create! :title => "Der Preis fürs Überleben"
  #     movie.slug #=> "der-preis-furs-uberleben"
  #
  # #### Column or Method?
  #
  # FriendlyId always uses a method as the basis of the slug text - not a column. At
  # first glance, this may sound confusing, but remember that Active Record provides
  # methods for each column in a model's associated table, and that's what
  # FriendlyId uses.
  #
  # Here's an example of a class that uses a custom method to generate the slug:
  #
  #     class Person < ActiveRecord::Base
  #       extend FriendlyId
  #       friendly_id :name_and_location, use: :slugged
  #
  #       def name_and_location
  #         "#{name} from #{location}"
  #       end
  #     end
  #
  #     bob = Person.create! :name => "Bob Smith", :location => "New York City"
  #     bob.friendly_id #=> "bob-smith-from-new-york-city"
  #
  # FriendlyId refers to this internally as the "base" method.
  #
  # #### Uniqueness
  #
  # When you try to insert a record that would generate a duplicate friendly id,
  # FriendlyId will append a UUID to the generated slug to ensure uniqueness:
  #
  #     car = Car.create :title => "Peugeot 206"
  #     car2 = Car.create :title => "Peugeot 206"
  #
  #     car.friendly_id #=> "peugeot-206"
  #     car2.friendly_id #=> "peugeot-206-f9f3789a-daec-4156-af1d-fab81aa16ee5"
  #
  # Previous versions of FriendlyId appended a numeric sequence to make slugs
  # unique, but this was removed to simplify using FriendlyId in concurrent code.
  #
  # #### Candidates
  #
  # Since UUIDs are ugly, FriendlyId provides a "slug candidates" functionality to
  # let you specify alternate slugs to use in the event the one you want to use is
  # already taken. For example:
  #
  #     class Restaurant < ActiveRecord::Base
  #       extend FriendlyId
  #       friendly_id :slug_candidates, use: :slugged
  #
  #       # Try building a slug based on the following fields in
  #       # increasing order of specificity.
  #       def slug_candidates
  #         [
  #           :name,
  #           [:name, :city],
  #           [:name, :street, :city],
  #           [:name, :street_number, :street, :city]
  #         ]
  #       end
  #     end
  #
  #     r1 = Restaurant.create! name: 'Plaza Diner', city: 'New Paltz'
  #     r2 = Restaurant.create! name: 'Plaza Diner', city: 'Kingston'
  #
  #     r1.friendly_id  #=> 'plaza-diner'
  #     r2.friendly_id  #=> 'plaza-diner-kingston'
  #
  # To use candidates, make your FriendlyId base method return an array. The
  # method need not be named `slug_candidates`; it can be anything you want. The
  # array may contain any combination of symbols, strings, procs or lambdas and
  # will be evaluated lazily and in order. If you include symbols, FriendlyId will
  # invoke a method on your model class with the same name. Strings will be
  # interpreted literally. Procs and lambdas will be called and their return values
  # used as the basis of the friendly id. If none of the candidates can generate a
  # unique slug, then FriendlyId will append a UUID to the first candidate as a
  # last resort.
  #
  # #### Sequence Separator
  #
  # By default, FriendlyId uses a dash to separate the slug from a sequence.
  #
  # You can change this with the {FriendlyId::Slugged::Configuration#sequence_separator
  # sequence_separator} configuration option.
  #
  # #### Providing Your Own Slug Processing Method
  #
  # You can override {FriendlyId::Slugged#normalize_friendly_id} in your model for
  # total control over the slug format. It will be invoked for any generated slug,
  # whether for a single slug or for slug candidates.
  #
  # #### Deciding When to Generate New Slugs
  #
  # As of FriendlyId 5.0, slugs are only generated when the `slug` field is nil. If
  # you want a slug to be regenerated,set the slug field to nil:
  #
  #     restaurant.friendly_id # joes-diner
  #     restaurant.name = "The Plaza Diner"
  #     restaurant.save!
  #     restaurant.friendly_id # joes-diner
  #     restaurant.slug = nil
  #     restaurant.save!
  #     restaurant.friendly_id # the-plaza-diner
  #
  # You can also override the
  # {FriendlyId::Slugged#should_generate_new_friendly_id?} method, which lets you
  # control exactly when new friendly ids are set:
  #
  #     class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
  #       extend FriendlyId
  #       friendly_id :title, :use => :slugged
  #
  #       def should_generate_new_friendly_id?
  #         title_changed?
  #       end
  #     end
  #
  # If you want to extend the default behavior but add your own conditions,
  # don't forget to invoke `super` from your implementation:
  #
  #     class Category < ActiveRecord::Base
  #       extend FriendlyId
  #       friendly_id :name, :use => :slugged
  #
  #       def should_generate_new_friendly_id?
  #         name_changed? || super
  #       end
  #     end
  #
  # #### Locale-specific Transliterations
  #
  # Active Support's `parameterize` uses
  # [transliterate](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveSupport/Inflector.html#method-i-transliterate),
  # which in turn can use I18n's transliteration rules to consider the current
  # locale when replacing Latin characters:
  #
  #     # config/locales/de.yml
  #     de:
  #       i18n:
  #         transliterate:
  #           rule:
  #             ü: "ue"
  #             ö: "oe"
  #             etc...
  #
  #     movie = Movie.create! :title => "Der Preis fürs Überleben"
  #     movie.slug #=> "der-preis-fuers-ueberleben"
  #
  # This functionality was in fact taken from earlier versions of FriendlyId.
  #
  # #### Gotchas: Common Problems
  #
  # FriendlyId uses a before_validation callback to generate and set the slug. This
  # means that if you create two model instances before saving them, it's possible
  # they will generate the same slug, and the second save will fail.
  #
  # This can happen in two fairly normal cases: the first, when a model using nested
  # attributes creates more than one record for a model that uses friendly_id. The
  # second, in concurrent code, either in threads or multiple processes.
  #
  # To solve the nested attributes issue, I recommend simply avoiding them when
  # creating more than one nested record for a model that uses FriendlyId. See [this
  # Github issue](https://github.com/norman/friendly_id/issues/185) for discussion.

    #
    # This method is not intended to be invoked directly; FriendlyId uses it

    #       def normalize_friendly_id(string)
