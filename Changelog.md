## 4.0.0 (2011-12-27)

This is a complete rewrite of FriendlyId, and introduces a smaller, faster and
less ambitious codebase. The primary change is the relegation of external slugs
to an optional addon, and the adoption of what were formerly "cached slugs"
as the primary way of handling slugging.

## Older releases

Please see the 3.x branch.
