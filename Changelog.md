* Documentation improvements (thanks [John Bachir](https://github.com/jjb)).
* Minor refactoring of internals (thanks [Gagan Ahwad](https://github.com/gaganawhad)).
* Set slug to `nil` on call to `dup` to ensure slug is generated ([#483](https://github.com/norman/friendly_id/pull/483)).

## 5.0.1 (2013-10-27)

* Fix compatibility with Rails 4.0.1.rc3 (thanks [Herman verschooten](https://github.com/Hermanverschooten)).

## 5.0.0 (2013-10-16)

* Fix to let scoped records reuse their slugs (thanks [Donny
  Kurnia](https://github.com/donnykurnia)).

## 5.0.0.rc.3 (2013-10-04)

* Support friendly finds on associations in Rails 4.0.1 and up. They will
  currently work on Rails 4.0 associations only if `:inverse_of` is not used.
  In Rails 4-0-stable, associations have been modified to use a special
  relation class, giving FriendlyId a consistent extension point. Since the
  behavior in 4.0.0 is considered defective and fixed in 4-0-stable, FriendlyId
  5.0 will not support friendly finds on inverse relelations in 4.0.0. For a
  reliable workaround, use the `friendly` scope for friendly finds on
  associations; this works on all Rails 4.0.x versions and will continue to be
  supported.
* Documentation fixes.

## 5.0.0.rc2 (2013-09-29)

* When the :finders addon has been included, use it in FriendlyId's internal
  finds to boost performance.
* Use instance methods rather than class methods in migrations.
* On find, fall back to super when the primary key is a character type. Thanks
  to [Jamie Davidson](https://github.com/jhdavids8).
* Fix reversion to previously used slug from history table when
  `should_generate_new_friendly_id?` is overridden.
* Fix sequencing of numeric slugs

## 5.0.0.rc1 (2013-08-28)

* Removed some outdated tests.
* Improved documentation.
* Removed Guide from repository and added tasks to maintain docs up to date
  on Github pages at http://norman.github.io/friendly_id.

## 5.0.0.beta4 (2013-08-21)

* Add an initializer to the generator; move the default reserved words there.
* Allow assignment from {FriendlyId::Configuration#base}.
* Fix bug whereby records could not reuse their own slugs.

## 5.0.0.beta3 (2013-08-20)

* Update gemspec to ensure FriendlyId 5.0 is only used with AR 4.0.x.

## 5.0.0.beta2 (2013-08-16)

* Add "finders" module to easily restore FriendlyId 4.0 finder behavior.

* Avoid using deprecated `update_attribute` (Philip Arndt).

* Added set_friendly_id method to Globalize module (Norman Clarke).

* autoload FriendlyId::Slug; previously this class was not accessible from
  migrations unless required explicitly, which could cause some queries to
  unexpectedly fail (Norman Clarke).

* Fix Mocha load order (Mark Turner).

* Minor doc updates (Rob Yurkowski).

* Other miscellaneous refactorings and doc updates.

## 4.0.7 (2012-06-06)

* to_param just calls super when no friendly id is present, to keep the model's
  default behavior. (Andrew White)

* Allow the scoped module to use multiple scopes (Ben Caldwell)
* Fixes for conflicting slugs in history module (Erik Ogan, Thomas Shafer, Evan Arnold)

## 4.0.0 (2011-12-27)

This is a complete rewrite of FriendlyId, and introduces a smaller, faster and
less ambitious codebase. The primary change is the relegation of external slugs
to an optional addon, and the adoption of what were formerly "cached slugs"
as the primary way of handling slugging.
