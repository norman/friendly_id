# FriendlyId

**For the most complete, user-friendly documentation, see the [FriendlyId Guide](https://norman.github.io/friendly_id/file.Guide.html).**

FriendlyId is the "Swiss Army bulldozer" of slugging and permalink plugins for
Active Record. It lets you create pretty URLs and work with human-friendly
strings as if they were numeric ids.

With FriendlyId, it's easy to make your application use URLs like:

    https://example.com/states/washington

instead of:

    https://example.com/states/4323454


## Getting Help

Ask questions on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/friendly-id)
using the "friendly-id" tag, and for bugs have a look at [the bug section](https://github.com/norman/friendly_id#bugs)

## FriendlyId Features

FriendlyId offers many advanced features, including:

 * slug history and versioning
 * i18n
 * scoped slugs
 * reserved words
 * custom slug generators

## Usage

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'friendly_id', '~> 5.4.0'
```

Note: You MUST use 5.0.0 or greater for Rails 4.0+.

And then execute:

```shell
bundle install
```

Add a `slug` column to the desired table (e.g. `Users`)
```shell
rails g migration AddSlugToUsers slug:uniq
```

Generate the friendly configuration file and a new migration

```shell
rails generate friendly_id
```

Note: You can delete the `CreateFriendlyIdSlugs` migration if you won't use the slug history feature. ([Read more](https://norman.github.io/friendly_id/FriendlyId/History.html))

Run the migration scripts

```shell
rails db:migrate
```

Edit the `app/models/user.rb` file as the following:

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  extend FriendlyId
  friendly_id :name, use: :slugged
end
```

Edit the `app/controllers/users_controller.rb` file and replace `User.find` by `User.friendly.find`

```ruby
class UserController < ApplicationController
  def show
    @user = User.friendly.find(params[:id])
  end
end
```

Now when you create a new user like the following:

```ruby
User.create! name: "Joe Schmoe"
```

You can then access the user show page using the URL http://localhost:3000/users/joe-schmoe.


If you're adding FriendlyId to an existing app and need to generate slugs for
existing users, do this from the console, runner, or add a Rake task:

```ruby
User.find_each(&:save)
```

## Options

### `:allow_nil`

You can pass `allow_nil: true` to the `friendly.find()` method if you're want to
avoid raising `ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound` and accept a `nil`.

#### Example

```ruby
MyModel.friendly.find("bad-slug") # where bad-slug is not a valid slug
MyModel.friendly.find(123)        # where 123 is not a valid primary key ID
MyModel.friendly.find(nil)        # when you have a variable/param that's possibly nil
#=> raise ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound

MyModel.friendly.find("bad-slug", allow_nil: true)
MyModel.friendly.find(123, allow_nil: true)
MyModel.friendly.find(nil, allow_nil: true)
#=> nil
```
